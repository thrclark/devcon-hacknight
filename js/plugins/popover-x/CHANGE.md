Initial release.

  all features of the [bootstrap modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals) and its methods are also available.

- Specially styles and spaces out bootstrap buttons added in popover footer. 
- Add a close icon/button to a popover window.
- Configure various prebuilt styles/templates. In addition to a default (grey), the bootstrap 3 contextual color styles of `primary`, 
  `info`, `success`, `danger`, and `warning` can be used.
- Control popover placements `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` of the target element.
- Specially style the popover arrow to be consistent for each contextual color and popover placement.
- Prebuilt CSS styles for controlling appearance and sizes of the popovers
